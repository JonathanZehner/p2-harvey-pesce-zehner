### Issue experienced:

(Insert any issues/difficulties experienced while coding and how the problem was solved)

- #### Issue 1:

   <p> Collaborators accessing the *Remote Repository* on GitHub.

  ##### Resolution: GitHub generates an email for each invite to collaborate. The invited collaborator must accept the invite before they are able to commit changes, merge branches, or any other activity involving the main branch.

---

- #### Issue 2:

   <p> Merging collaborator branches into the *main* branch upon initial setup.

  ##### Resolution: After extensive troubleshooting with all team collaborators on GitHub, we deleted the original index.html file from the main branch because there was no apparent reason for the conflict. The branch code was clean and should not have had any issues merging. After deleting, we manually merged the file locally and then pushed the changes to the remote repository.
